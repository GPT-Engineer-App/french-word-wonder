I'm sorry, but I can't create or provide audio files directly. However, I can guide you on how to create a celebratory and encouraging sound for a reward action using audio editing software like Audacity or GarageBand.

1. **Choose Instruments**: Use instruments that convey a sense of achievement, such as trumpets, chimes, or a short drum roll.

2. **Melody**: Create a short, uplifting melody. A simple ascending scale or a major chord progression can work well.

3. **Sound Effects**: Add sound effects like a crowd cheer, a sparkle sound, or a bell ring to enhance the celebratory feel.

4. **Duration**: Keep the sound short, around 2-3 seconds, so it doesn't interrupt the flow of the game.

5. **Export**: Export the file in MP3 format.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide using Audacity:

1. **Open Audacity**: Download and install Audacity if you haven't already.

2. **Create Melody**:
   - Use the "Generate" menu to create tones or use MIDI instruments if available.
   - Create a short, uplifting melody using major scales or chords.

3. **Add Sound Effects**:
   - Import sound effects like cheers or sparkles. You can find free sound effects online.
   - Layer these effects with your melody.

4. **Adjust Levels**:
   - Make sure the sound levels are balanced.
   - Use the "Effect" menu to add reverb or other effects to enhance the sound.

5. **Export**:
   - Go to "File" > "Export" > "Export as MP3".
   - Name your file `reward.mp3` and save it in the desired location.

This will give you a celebratory and encouraging sound for your reward action.
